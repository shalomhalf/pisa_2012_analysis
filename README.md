# PISA 2012 Exploration
## by Shalom Halfon


## Dataset
> The database consists of questionnaire answers and test results of almost half a million children born in 1996, the questionnaire was conducted in 2012. The questionnaire was collected from a random sample represented in 68 different countries that requested to be included in the test.
> As far as I understand, the database was taken from the PISA website and the udacity team converted it from SPSS to CSV.

## Summary of Findings

> It is known in the education research field that the socio-economic index has an effect on student achievement in school, in the PISA 2012 data base this correlation could be seen clearly.
>There is a significant correlation of mother's presence at home on the student's grades. The correlation between the presence of a father at home on the student's grades exists but is significantly weaker.
> The ESCS index is an integration of various characteristics measured in the study and gives a number that represents the student's socioeconomic index. By examining the entire database and by examining each country separately, a correlation can be seen between the student's ESCS score and his grades. A different correlation strength was observed between the countries.
> It is my opinion that the strength of the correlation between the socioeconomic index and the student's grades is a relatively good assessment, even if a little superficial, of the level of equality in the education system in different countries.
> The smaller the correlation, it can be assumed that the education system in the country provides the same level of education to all students.
> In order to confirm my thesis, a comparison is needed here between the research countries over the years and an examination of the trends.

## Key Insights for Presentation

>Educational systems around the world see different importance in the right to equality in education (educational justice). Creating a test to stand for equality in the system over time and its effects on student achievement can give us many insights and help in the public discourse and data-based policy promotion.
> The PISA database is an amazing tool for international comparison of the various education systems. Caution is required and it is dangerous to draw conclusions from measurements of only one year, yet the examination of the trends throughout the years of the study can greatly contribute to the participating countries and the field of education research.
